# How to create a Stock chart


<p>The following example demonstrates how to create aÂ  <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/CustomDocument2987">Stock</a> chart at runtime.</p>
<p>Note that this series view type is associated with theÂ  <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#CoreLibraries/clsDevExpressXtraChartsXYDiagramtopic">XY-Diagram</a>Â type, and you should cast your <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#CoreLibraries/clsDevExpressXtraChartsDiagramtopic">diagram</a>Â object to this type, in order to access its specific options.</p>
<p>Also, note that starting from the v2010 vol 2 version, you can exclude non-working days (weekends and holidays) from an axis range, via the <strong>WorkdaysOnly</strong> and <strong>WorkdaysOptions</strong> properties. For details on this, refer to <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E2365">How to exclude weekends and holidays from the axis range</a>.</p>
